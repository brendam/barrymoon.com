Ear Trading is an iPhone app that was available for free from the Apple App Store. It was created to test ideas about sonification, namely whether sonified data could help a user make intelligent decisions. The data for Ear Trading is streamed in real-time from [BATS Exchange](http://batstrading.com/). We turn that data into sound and image to create a game where the player trades in imaginary shares.
