This is a game I am making based on a text by Chris Danowski. It was presented at the Interactive Fiction Demo Fair in Boston, although I am not sure that it is fiction. Most people probably wouldn't consider it a game either. I like the suggestion "experience".
It is programmed in the Unity environment.
Here are links the latest version with three levels. Eventually it will have five levels and probably more direction to it:

The videos here are "walkthroughs" of each of the three levels:

Louis Moon's voice and Doug Nottingham's drums feature in the music tracks.
