This piece was written for ArtOnStage: [Anne-Mette Skovbjerg](http://www.myspace.com/annemetteskovbjerg) \- guitar and [Christina Dahl](http://www.myspace.com/christinadahl) \- voice. The text, and inspiration for the theme came from [Janus Kodal](http://www.januskodal.dk/). I wanted to create a musical theater, where Anne-Mette and Christina could perform as Picasso or Cronhamer. The score is fully written, with stage directions. I embraced the opportunity to let my modernist flag fly, remembering the Boulez quote:

> “I think that music should be collective hysteria and enchantment, violently modern.”
