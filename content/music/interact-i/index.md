Interact I was written for flutist Elizabeth McNutt. The score consists of three large sheets, all of which are visible to the flutist in performance. The flutist chooses materials to play according to some simple rules in response to the computer. The computer follows the pitches of the flute, determining what part of the score the performer is playing from.Changes in processing are made according to that determination. Thus, the flutist shapes the piece in performance. Score following techniques developed for this piece were further enhanced by John Lawter, who developed an external object for Max/MSP.
