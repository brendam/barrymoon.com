This piece was written in collaboration with choreographer Adele Levi, and performed by Clive Andrews, Katherine Nietrzebka, Maria Ramos, and John O'Hara. The development of motion-tracking techniques in [SoftVNS](http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/softVNS.html) was supported by a grant by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx).
