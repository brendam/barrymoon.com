Surface Noise was created in collaboration with Chris Danowski. Devised as an "installation/performance", there were interactive elements for the audience to play with. One of these interactive pieces was a "doll house switchboard" shown below, where plugs in jacks modified sound.

There were many sections to the 40-minute performance. Video accompaniment ran throughout. Christina Dahl performed the voice and lead theatrical role, Chris and I acted as the "sidekicks". Laura Moon constructed most of the installation. Louis Moon built a computer and solved Windows XP problems. Stan Bosch played drums on the recordings. Here are some videos from/of the piece:
