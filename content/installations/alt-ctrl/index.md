This installation was developed with [Patricia Clark](http://thecolectiva.com/?page_id=13) and [Luis Gomez](http://thecolectiva.com/?page_id=8).

Positions and movements of gallery patrons are analyzed via Kinect and used to create and manipulate video, image, and sound. An additional element displays links relevant to the message of the installation that is only revealed using polarized glasses.

alt ctrl has been shown at ASU, the Havana Biennial, and University of South Florida.
