This installation was created in collaboration with [Scott Pagano](http://vimeo.com/channels/neitherfield). Visitors to the installation were encouraged to use wiiremotes - there were two wiiremotes, each manipulating video on one of two screens. The video I created displayed a 3D space navigated by and painted into with the wiiremote. My video was sent to Scott's software, which applied effects to the image. These effects were manipulated by the second wiiremote.
Visitors to the installation were also able to print an image of their creation by clicking a wiiremote button.
The first of these videos is of Scott and I performing in the installation, and the second is the output of each of our software environments captured digitally.
