This installation is a prototype for a public art proposal created with Hilary Harp. The group I am a member of that will produce the more elaborate installation is the "Public Art Challenge", funded by [The Center for Critical Inquiry and Cultural Studies (CCICS)](http://ccics.asu.edu/), a unit within the Division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies (HArCS) of Arizona State Universityâ€™s New College. The larger piece will be installed in Scottsdale in 2012.
This piece uses a sensor on a pendulum measuring the rotation applied by the user. A computer program then takes this analysis and plays back audio and controls the swinging of an upper pendulum. I wanted to try and create the impression of something completely mechanical, where sound and mechanics were perceived of as coming from the energy put into the system by the user.
