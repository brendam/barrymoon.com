boidSong is a surreal immersion of disparate boids, emergent in life like behaviour and explorative ‘simple rules’ interaction. boids communicate by emitting faint clicks when they change direction. Long musical phrases depict the metaphorical air upon which they float and breathe.

Each boid uses simple rules and the locations of all the other boids to control its behaviour and ‘song’. The behaviour of the boids is also affected by the amount of physical movement in a space detected by an image device. As the movement in the room increases, the movement of the boids also increases.
