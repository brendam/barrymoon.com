Nests is an installation developed with [Robert Kilman](https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/514633). Objects relating to concepts of "body" are scattered on a table. By connecting plugs hanging from a mannequin to jacks in the table, users effect changes in video projections, sound, and LED strip illuminations.
