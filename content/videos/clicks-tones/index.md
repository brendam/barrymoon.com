In retrospect this looks a little iTunes Visualizer, but there is something enduring about the simplicity. The tune was written with the visual in mind. Analysis of the tune controls parameters of the visualization, namely the vertical offset of a single pixel wide line. The visualization effects are performed in real time. Multiple performances can add more of the human to an otherwise digital land/sound scape.
