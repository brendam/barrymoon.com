Mince was my first substantial piece made for video. I was interested in making the sound and image equally absorbing. I wanted to treat the 5.1 channels of surround sound as spatially distinct, but sonically similar, to create immersive music. For the video, my main concern was to capture heavily rhythmic images, and not rely on effects to create movement.
