2009 version of a piece originally performed in Bristol UK in 2003. This performance was shot at [Teatro Caliente](http://www.timb.org/TIMB/TEATRO_CALIENTE.html) in Phoenix, Halloween (hence the costume) 2009.
The text is edited from [this](http://archive.groovy.net/dl/elerev.html) somewhat famous essay by William Burroughs.
Laura Moon narrated the text.
