College Ave plays with the portability of space and time. The background video not only carries a contrasting space and time into the performance space, but directs the musicians. This idea probably came from having performed several silent-movie soundtracks in various groups. For me, in the ideal situation, the musicians' input can be analyzed to affect the progression of the video. In this case I opted for higher resolution over processing speed, and so the video remains unblemished. The only change in the video is a fade in and red tint, which is a completely obscure reference to [Michael Snow's "Wavelength"](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3009876496807585942#). One of my favorite movies.

This performance was recorded at University of North Texas in 2010, featuring the Nova Ensemble directed by Elizabeth McNutt. The musicians are: Sarah Summar - violin, Andrew Broz - cello, Michael Garman - clarinet, Jeffery Kyle Hutchins - alto saxophone, Susan Anderson - horn, Jeremiah Stones - bass trombone, Elizabeth Stelzer - piano, Patrick Peringer - electric guitar and technical assistant.
