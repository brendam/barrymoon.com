Postcard is a piece for chair and computer generated/manipulated image and sound. Video images come from [Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells), the place where I bought the chair and lived for five years. The sound is largely synthesized, using techniques such as chaos, and comb-filtered noise. Moving my hands in front and behind the chair controls the video and sound using [SoftVNS](http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/softVNS.html) for motion analysis. SoftVNS allows the definition of regions according to a mask. In this case the regions and mask are defined by a drawing of the parts of the chair.
