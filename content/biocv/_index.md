Barry Moon - Bio

I combine various forms of art and technology to create works that encourage interaction between humans and computers. My works for instrumental performance and computer have been performed at the International Computer Music Conference in 1998, 2004, and 2006. Other venues where this body of my work has received international attention has been at the Australian Computer Music Conference in Melbourne, the Sonic Circuits festival in Toronto, the InterCollege Computer Music festival in Tokyo, the MIX.01 in Aarhus, Festival in Denmark and Sweden, the MAXIS Festival in Leeds UK, Digital Arts and Culture Conference in Doncaster UK, the real-time/non real time festival, Basel, Switzerland, and Śląskie Dni Muzyki Współczesnej in Katowice Poland. Many of my works for performance with computer have involved the development of novel means of communication between performer(s) and computer such as “Open-form Score Following” techniques used in my Interact I, Interact II, and Electronic Revolution, and the “video score” used in the recent College Ave.

I have created numerous performance works and installations incorporating video processing. I have also started making computer games. "Ear Trading" developed in collaboration with my sister Brenda is a game using music to help guide the player through the decision-making process as they trade imaginary stocks on the stock market.
I am Assistant Professor in the Interdisciplinary Arts and Performance program at Arizona State University.
